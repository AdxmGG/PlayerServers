# [ PlayerServers ]
A script that allows players to create their own servers within a server.

## [ Features ]
* Create and manage servers as if it were a real external server.
* View all online servers and easily connect to them from one main lobby.
* Playerserver owners can control their own server. For example by making users server operators, banning users, or enabling a whitelist.
* You, as the network owner, will be able to completely manage the servers. For example set player and plugin slots, or suspend servers.
* You, as the network owner, can suspend servers if a player server breaks your rules. This means it cannot be started, not even the owner of the playerserver can start it.
* There are so many more features for both the network owner and the playerserver owner, just use the script!

## [ To Note ]
* We brand worlds as 'servers', this is not a bungee cord network but worlds on your server.
* We brand custom scripted addons as 'plugins'.
* The Addons module has not been released yet, so nobody will be able to install plugins to their server. This will be releasing very soon.
